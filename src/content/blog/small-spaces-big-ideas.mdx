# Small Spaces, Big Ideas

Not every project is a 500-square-meter warehouse conversion. Some of our most rewarding work happens in spaces under 50 square meters.

## The Small Space Mindset

The first mistake people make with small spaces is trying to make them look bigger. **Stop. Embrace the coziness.** A small space done well is intimate, efficient, and full of character.

> "Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful." — William Morris

In a small space, this isn't just advice — it's a survival strategy.

## 7 Principles We Live By

### 1. Every Centimeter Has a Job

In a small space, idle square footage is a luxury you can't afford. That awkward corner under the stairs? Custom shelving. The gap between the fridge and the wall? Pull-out pantry.

### 2. Vertical is Your Best Friend

When you can't go wide, go up. Floor-to-ceiling shelving, hanging planters, wall-mounted desks — vertical space is free real estate.

### 3. Light is Space

Natural light makes walls disappear. If you can't add windows:

- Use mirrors strategically
- Choose light-colored surfaces
- Install LED strips under cabinets and shelves
- Use sheer curtains instead of heavy drapes

### 4. Furniture Does Double Duty

Every piece of furniture should serve at least two purposes:

- **Ottoman**: Seating + Storage
- **Dining table**: Work desk + Dining
- **Bed frame**: Sleeping + Drawers underneath
- **Wall shelf**: Display + Workspace

### 5. Consistent Materials

Using the same 2-3 materials throughout creates visual continuity that makes spaces feel larger. We often use:

- One wood tone
- One metal finish
- One accent color

### 6. Hidden Everything

Clutter is the enemy of small spaces. Design for hiding:

- Integrated appliances with panel-ready fronts
- Recessed medicine cabinets
- Built-in charging stations
- Concealed cable management

### 7. One Bold Move

Every small space needs one moment of drama — a feature wall, a statement light fixture, a pop of unexpected color. This gives the eye a focal point and distracts from the compact dimensions.

## Case Study: 28sqm Studio Apartment

We recently transformed a 28-square-meter studio into a fully functional home with:

- Sleeping area with queen bed and storage
- Full kitchen with dishwasher
- Work-from-home desk
- Living area with 2-person sofa
- Bathroom with walk-in shower

The secret? A custom-built loft bed platform with the kitchen and bathroom tucked underneath, and a fold-down desk that doubles as a dining table.

**The client's reaction:** *"I can't believe this is the same apartment."*

That's the power of thoughtful design in small spaces.
