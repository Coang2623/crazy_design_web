# The Art of Choosing Materials

Materials are the vocabulary of design. Choose the right words, and your space tells a compelling story. Choose wrong, and the message gets lost.

## Why Materials Matter More Than You Think

When clients walk into a space we've designed, they don't consciously think about the materials. But their **subconscious registers everything** — the warmth of wood grain beneath their fingertips, the cool smoothness of a marble countertop, the soft texture of handmade tiles.

> "Materials are the colors of architecture." — Richard Meier

## Our Selection Process

### Step 1: Understanding the Story

Before choosing a single material, we ask: *What story does this space need to tell?*

A coffee shop in a converted warehouse tells a different story than a luxury spa in a new building. The materials must honor the narrative.

### Step 2: The Touch Test

We never specify a material we haven't physically handled. Our studio has a **materials library** with over 500 samples — woods, stones, metals, fabrics, and composites.

Every material gets evaluated on:

- **Visual texture**: How it looks under different lighting
- **Tactile quality**: How it feels to touch
- **Acoustic properties**: How it reflects or absorbs sound
- **Durability**: How it ages and weathers
- **Sustainability**: Where it comes from and how it's produced

### Step 3: The Palette

Like colors, materials need to work together. We create material palettes — 3 to 5 primary materials that form the foundation of a project.

**Example: Nomad Coffee Roasters**

| Material | Role | Source |
|----------|------|--------|
| Reclaimed teak | Warmth & character | Fishing boats, Central Vietnam |
| Powder-coated steel | Structure & contrast | Local fabricator |
| Polished concrete | Durability & modernity | Cast on-site |
| Raw brass | Accent & patina | Imported fittings |
| Handmade ceramic | Detail & craft | Local potter collaboration |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too many materials**: More than 5 primary materials creates visual chaos
2. **Ignoring aging**: Some materials look great new but terrible at year 3
3. **Forgetting maintenance**: Beautiful terrazzo floors need regular sealing
4. **Sustainability theater**: Just because it's "natural" doesn't mean it's sustainable

## Our Favorites Right Now

- **Rammed earth**: Incredible texture, zero waste, perfect for feature walls
- **Terrazzo**: The comeback king — endlessly customizable
- **Cork**: Warm, acoustic, sustainable, and vastly underused
- **Oxidized copper**: Living material that develops unique patina over time

The right material doesn't just look good — it feels right, ages gracefully, and makes a space truly memorable.
