# Project Zero

Welcome to Project Zero. This is where it all begins — a manifesto for daring design.

## The Concept

We wanted to push the boundaries of *minimalism* and *maximalism* simultaneously. Is that even possible? We believe so.

> "In design, less isn't always more. Sometimes more is more — when it's done right."

The idea was born from a simple observation: most websites look exactly the same. Same templates, same layouts, same boring grids. We wanted something different.

### Key Features

- **Glassmorphism Everywhere**: Using backdrop-filter extensively to create depth and dimension that traditional flat design cannot achieve.
- **Performance First**: Despite the visual complexity, we maintained a 100/100 Lighthouse score through careful optimization.
- **Interactive**: Every element responds to cursor movement, creating a living, breathing interface.
- **Dark Mode**: Seamless transition between light and dark themes with custom color palettes for each.

## The Process

We started with wireframes on paper — yes, actual paper. Then moved to Figma for high-fidelity mockups. The development phase used React with Framer Motion for animations.

### Technologies Used

1. **React 18** with Server Components
2. **Framer Motion** for declarative animations
3. **Tailwind CSS** for rapid styling
4. **Vite** for blazing fast builds

## Result

The result is what you see before you. A truly *crazy* design that pushes boundaries while remaining functional and accessible. The project garnered attention from design communities worldwide and was featured on Awwwards.
