# Nomad Coffee Roasters

When the founders of Nomad approached us, they had a vision: a coffee shop that feels like a friend's living room but looks like it belongs in a design magazine.

## The Brief

The space was a former warehouse — 200 square meters of raw potential. The brief was simple yet challenging:

1. **Keep the industrial DNA** of the building
2. **Make it warm** enough for hours-long work sessions
3. **Design custom furniture** that tells a story
4. **Create Instagram moments** without being gimmicky

## Our Approach

### Custom Furniture

Every table in Nomad is unique. We sourced reclaimed wood from old fishing boats in Central Vietnam and combined them with powder-coated steel frames designed in-house.

> "The best furniture doesn't just fill a space — it tells a story."

The signature piece is the 4-meter communal table, carved from a single slab of walnut, supported by custom-welded industrial legs.

### Lighting Design

We designed a constellation of handmade ceramic pendant lights, each slightly different in shape and color temperature. The result is a warm, organic glow that changes throughout the day.

### The Coffee Bar

The bar itself is a statement piece: polished concrete top with embedded LED edge lighting, backed by a wall of exposed copper pipes that double as the water system.

## Branding Integration

The interior design extends to the brand:

- **Menu boards**: Hand-painted directly on reclaimed wood
- **Cups & Packaging**: Custom designs that echo the interior patterns
- **Staff uniforms**: Designed to complement the color palette

## Impact

Nomad has become one of the top-rated coffee shops in the city, with a **4.8 star rating** and regular features in local design blogs. The custom furniture line has since been made available for retail.
