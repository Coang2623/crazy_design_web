# The Maker Studio

A 350-square-meter creative workspace designed for the hands that make things. The Maker Studio is home to ceramicists, woodworkers, textile artists, and digital creators — all under one roof.

## Challenge

The client needed a space that could accommodate wildly different creative disciplines without feeling chaotic. The space needed to be:

- **Flexible**: Easily reconfigured for workshops and exhibitions
- **Durable**: Withstand the daily wear of creative work
- **Inspiring**: Every corner should spark ideas

## Design Solution

### Zoning Without Walls

Instead of traditional walls, we created zones using:

- **Changes in floor material** — epoxy for messy work, hardwood for clean areas
- **Ceiling height variations** — lower ceilings for focused work, double-height for exhibitions
- **Movable screens** made from recycled fabric panels on industrial tracks

### The Gallery Wall

A 12-meter curved wall runs through the center of the space, serving as both a gallery for finished works and a room divider. It's finished in raw plaster, allowing artists to pin, hang, and project onto its surface.

### Utility Infrastructure

Every workstation has access to:

- 3-phase power for heavy machinery
- Compressed air
- Water (hot and cold)
- Dust extraction systems hidden in the ceiling

## Community Impact

Since opening, The Maker Studio has:

- Hosted **48 workshops** in its first year
- Provided studio space for **22 resident artists**
- Launched **3 collaborative exhibitions**
- Generated **$120K in creative economy** value for the neighborhood
