# Serenity Spa & Wellness

A space designed to heal, inspire, and transform. Serenity Spa represents the perfect harmony between modern architecture and timeless wellness philosophy.

## Design Philosophy

The client wanted a space that *whispers rather than shouts*. Every material, every color, every angle was chosen to create a sense of calm from the moment you step through the door.

> "Architecture is the thoughtful making of space." — Louis Kahn

### Material Palette

- **Natural Stone**: Imported travertine for walls and reception
- **Warm Woods**: Japanese oak for warm accent surfaces
- **Water Features**: Integrated flowing water elements for ambient sound
- **Living Walls**: Vertical gardens bringing nature indoors

## Key Spaces

### Reception & Lounge

The reception area features a curved desk in polished concrete, backed by a living wall of ferns. Ambient lighting shifts with the time of day, creating a circadian-friendly environment.

### Treatment Rooms

Each of the 6 treatment rooms has its own character while maintaining the overall design language. Heated stone floors, adjustable lighting, and built-in sound systems create a fully customizable experience.

### Meditation Garden

The crown jewel — an indoor zen garden with a glass ceiling that lets natural light filter through. River stones, bamboo, and a shallow reflecting pool create a space for mindfulness.

## Results

- **Award**: Best Spa Design 2025 by Interior Design Association
